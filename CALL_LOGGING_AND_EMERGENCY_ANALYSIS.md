# Call Logging and Emergency Setup Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**  

---

## üîç **Issues Found**

### **Issue 1: Call Logging Not Working** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Problem**: Appointments were being created successfully, but no call logs were appearing in the call history.

**Root Cause**: The `handleCallStarted` method in the webhook handler was missing the `phone_number` field when calling `logCallEvent()`.

**Location**: `lib/webhooks/multilingual-webhook-handler.ts` line 395-400

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (missing phone_number)
await this.logCallEvent(customerId, 'call_started', {
  callId: webhookData.call?.id,
  language,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
})

// AFTER (includes phone_number)
await this.logCallEvent(customerId, 'call_started', {
  callId: webhookData.call?.id,
  phoneNumber: webhookData.call?.from || webhookData.message?.call?.from || '',
  language,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
})
```

**Result**: Call logs will now be properly created when calls start, showing up in the call history.
