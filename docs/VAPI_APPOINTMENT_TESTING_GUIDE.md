# üß™ Vapi Appointment Booking - Testing Guide

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: ‚úÖ **All Fixes Applied - Ready for Testing**

---

## üìã What Was Fixed

### Issue #1: Database Schema Mismatch ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: Webhook was using wrong field names that don't exist in database
- **Fix**: Corrected field mapping in `lib/webhooks/tool-call-handlers.ts`
  - `service_type` ‚Üí `appointment_type`
  - `scheduled_start_time` ‚Üí `scheduled_date` + `scheduled_time` (split into two fields)
  - Added `duration_minutes` calculation based on service type

### Issue #2: Vapi Response Format ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: Webhook returned wrong format, Vapi couldn't parse it ‚Üí showed "No result returned"
- **Fix**: Updated `lib/webhooks/multilingual-webhook-handler.ts` to return Vapi's expected format:
  ```json
  {
    "results": [
      {
        "toolCallId": "call_xxx",
        "result": "{\"appointment_id\":\"123\",...}",
        "error": null
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Issue #3: No Error Visibility ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: Errors were silent, no way to debug
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive logging at every step with detailed error messages

## üß™ How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure your dev server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Verify Twilio credentials are in `.env.local` (optional - SMS is non-blocking)
3. Have your Vapi AI assistant phone number ready

---

### Test 1: Basic Appointment Booking ‚úÖ

**What to Test**: Create an appointment via Vapi phone call

**Steps**:
1. Call your Vapi AI assistant phone number
2. Say: "I'd like to book an appointment"
3. Provide the following information:
   - **Name**: "Lawrence"
   - **Phone**: "+14099952315"
   - **Email**: "law@one.com"
   - **Service type**: "maintenance"
   - **Address**: "4515 Brumny Lane"
   - **Date/Time**: "Next Tuesday at 4pm"

**Expected Results**:

#### A. In Server Logs (Console)
You should see logs like this:
```
üìÖ Processing appointment booking for organization [org-id] in en
üìã Tool call arguments: {
  "service_type": "maintenance",
  "customer_name": "Lawrence",
  "customer_phone": "+14099952315",
  "customer_email": "law@one.com",
  "address": "4515 Brumny Lane",
  "scheduled_start_time": "2025-10-15T16:00:00",
  "sms_preference": true,
  "preferred_language": "en",
  "cultural_formality": "formal"
}
üìÖ Creating appointment: maintenance on 2025-10-15 at 16:00:00
‚úÖ Appointment created successfully: [appointment-id]
‚úÖ SMS confirmation sent to +14099952315
‚úÖ Appointment booking completed successfully: [appointment-id]
üîß Processing 1 tool calls in en
‚úÖ Tool call book_appointment_with_sms: success
```

#### B. In Vapi Dashboard (Tool Response)
You should see:
```json
Tool Response
{
  "results": [
    {
      "toolCallId": "call_xxx",
      "result": "{\"appointment_id\":\"abc-123\",\"appointment_type\":\"maintenance\",\"scheduled_date\":\"2025-10-15\",\"scheduled_time\":\"16:00:00\",\"customer_name\":\"Lawrence\",\"sms_confirmation_sent\":true}"
    }
  ]
}
```

**NOT**:
```
Tool Response
No result returned.  ‚ùå
```

#### C. In Database
Run this query:
```sql
SELECT
  id,
  organization_id,
  customer_name,
  customer_phone,
  customer_email,
  appointment_type,
  scheduled_date,
  scheduled_time,
  duration_minutes,
  service_address,
  language_preference,
  status,
  created_at
FROM appointments
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Expected result:
```
id: [uuid]
organization_id: [org-id]
customer_name: Lawrence
customer_phone: +14099952315
customer_email: law@one.com
appointment_type: maintenance
scheduled_date: 2025-10-15
scheduled_time: 16:00:00
duration_minutes: 60
service_address: 4515 Brumny Lane
language_preference: en
status: pending
```

#### D. AI Assistant Response
The AI should say something like:
> "Perfect! I've scheduled your maintenance appointment for Tuesday, October 15th at 4:00 PM at 4515 Brumny Lane. You'll receive a confirmation SMS shortly at +14099952315."

### Test 2: Different Service Types ‚úÖ

Test that duration is calculated correctly for each service type.

**Test Cases**:

| Service Type | Expected Duration | Test Date/Time |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| emergency    | 120 minutes       | Tomorrow 10am  |
| repair       | 90 minutes        | Wednesday 2pm  |
| maintenance  | 60 minutes        | Friday 4pm     |
| installation | 180 minutes       | Next Monday 9am |

**For Each Service Type**:
1. Call and request appointment
2. Specify the service type
3. Check database: `duration_minutes` should match expected

**Example SQL Check**:
```sql
SELECT appointment_type, duration_minutes, scheduled_date, scheduled_time
FROM appointments
WHERE customer_name = 'Lawrence'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

---

### Test 3: Error Validation ‚úÖ

**What to Test**: Verify validation catches missing or invalid data

#### Test 3A: Missing Required Field
1. Call Vapi assistant
2. Start booking appointment
3. **Skip providing phone number** (or any required field)

**Expected**:
- Server logs: `‚ùå Validation failed: Missing required fields: customer_phone`
- Vapi shows error in tool response
- AI assistant asks for the missing information

#### Test 3B: Invalid Date Format
1. Call Vapi assistant
2. Provide all details but say "garbage date"

**Expected**:
- Server logs: `‚ùå Invalid date format: garbage date`
- Vapi shows error in tool response
- AI assistant asks for valid date/time

---

### Test 4: SMS Confirmation (Optional) ‚úÖ

**What to Test**: SMS is sent but doesn't block appointment creation

**Setup**: Ensure Twilio credentials are in `.env.local`:
```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

**Test**:
1. Book appointment with valid phone number
2. Check if SMS is received

**Expected**:
- If Twilio configured: SMS received with appointment confirmation
- If Twilio NOT configured: Log shows `‚ö†Ô∏è SMS confirmation failed: [error]` but appointment still created

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No result returned" still appears

**Check server logs for**:

#### A. Validation Error
```
‚ùå Validation failed: Missing required fields: [field_name]
```
‚Üí **Fix**: Ensure Vapi assistant is providing all required fields

#### B. Database Error
```
‚ùå Database error creating appointment: [error message]
```
‚Üí **Fix**: Check database schema, RLS policies, or constraints

#### C. Date Parsing Error
```
‚ùå Invalid date format: [date]
```
‚Üí **Fix**: Ensure Vapi assistant is sending ISO 8601 datetime format

---

### Problem: Appointment created but user not notified

**Symptoms**:
- ‚úÖ Database has appointment record
- ‚úÖ Server logs show success
- ‚ùå AI doesn't tell user

**Fix**: Update Vapi assistant's system prompt:
```
When you successfully book an appointment, tell the customer:
"Great! I've booked your [service_type] appointment for [date] at [time] at [address].
You'll receive a confirmation SMS shortly at [phone]."
```

---

### Problem: Wrong duration_minutes in database

**Check**:
1. What service type was requested?
2. What duration is in database?

**Expected Mappings**:
- emergency ‚Üí 120 minutes
- repair ‚Üí 90 minutes
- maintenance ‚Üí 60 minutes
- installation ‚Üí 180 minutes
- default ‚Üí 60 minutes

**Fix**: If duration is wrong, check `calculateDuration()` method in `lib/webhooks/tool-call-handlers.ts:400-414`

---

## üìä Success Criteria

**All of these must be true**:
1. ‚úÖ Server logs show "Appointment created successfully: [id]"
2. ‚úÖ Vapi shows tool response with `appointment_id` and other details
3. ‚úÖ Database has new appointment record with ALL correct fields
4. ‚úÖ AI assistant tells user "Appointment booked successfully"
5. ‚úÖ No "No result returned" message in Vapi
