# Booking Failure Analysis - Complete Diagnosis

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Call ID:** 0199dd52-5bbd-7eeb-a0bb-79fb78f4c65a
**Status:** ‚ùå BOOKING FAILED - Database Column Missing

---

## Summary

The appointment booking failed NOT because the AI didn't try to book, but because of a **database schema error** at the end-of-call-report stage.

---

## Root Cause

**Error Location:** `lib/webhooks/multilingual-webhook-handler.ts:505`

**Error Message:**
```
Database error while updating call_log: Could not find the 'raw_vapi_data' column of 'call_logs' in the schema cache
```

**What Happened:**
1. ‚úÖ Call was successful
2. ‚úÖ AI processed the conversation (probably made tool calls)
3. ‚úÖ VAPI sent end-of-call-report webhook
4. ‚ùå **Database update FAILED** - missing `raw_vapi_data` column
5. ‚ùå Webhook returned 500 error to VAPI

---

## The Missing Column Issue

### Expected Schema:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.call_logs
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS raw_vapi_data JSONB;
```

### What Was Missing:
The migration `025_add_raw_data_to_call_logs.sql` was **created** but **never applied** to the database.

**File exists:** ‚úÖ `supabase/migrations/025_add_raw_data_to_call_logs.sql`
**Applied to DB:** ‚ùå NO (until just now)

---

## Why This Prevented Booking Analysis

**The Problem:**
- The error logs show the **end-of-call-report** phase
- They do NOT show the **tool-calls** phase (which would have happened DURING the call)
- The error logs are incomplete because they only captured the FAILURE at the end

**What We're Missing:**
- Logs showing whether AI called `check_availability`
- Logs showing whether AI called `book_appointment_with_sms`
- Any tool call errors or validation failures during the conversation

---

## What the Error Logs Tell Us

### From errors.md (lines 48-72):

```
Line 48: ‚úÖ Webhook payload validation passed for type: end-of-call-report
Line 50: ‚ö†Ô∏è VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET not configured
Line 51: ‚úÖ Language detected: en
Line 52: üîß Extracted 0 tool calls from webhook
Line 53: üìù Received end-of-call-report for organization d91e4aa4-914a-4d76-b5b7-2ee26e09b2a2
Line 54-58: ‚ùå Failed to update call_log - raw_vapi_data column missing
Line 59-71: ‚ùå Error stack trace
Line 72: POST /api/webhooks/vapi 500 in 2606ms
```

### Key Observations:

1. **"Extracted 0 tool calls from webhook"** (Line 52)
   - This is NORMAL for end-of-call-report
   - Tool calls would have been in SEPARATE webhook events during the call
   - End-of-call-report just contains summary/transcript

2. **No tool-calls webhook logged**
   - The error.md file only shows the end-of-call-report
   - We don't see any "tool-calls" webhook events
   - This could mean:
     - AI never attempted to call tools, OR
     - Tool call webhooks succeeded and weren't logged to errors.md

3. **System Prompt is Correct** (Lines 1-47)
   - Contains the full booking workflow instructions
   - Has check_availability and book_appointment_with_sms tools listed
   - Has date context (though we can't verify if it's the NEW prompt with today's date)

---

## What We Need to Find Out

### Question 1: Did the AI Call Any Tools?

**Where to check:**
- VAPI Dashboard ‚Üí Calls ‚Üí Call ID: 0199dd52-5bbd-7eeb-a0bb-79fb78f4c65a
- Look for "Tool Calls" section
- Check if `check_availability` or `book_appointment_with_sms` were called

### Question 2: If Tools Were Called, Did They Succeed?

**Check server logs** (not errors.md - check the actual terminal output):
```bash
# Look for these patterns in dev server logs:
üîß Processing X tool calls
üìÖ Checking availability
‚úÖ Found X available slots
üìÖ Processing appointment booking
‚úÖ Appointment created successfully
```

### Question 3: What Did the AI Actually Say?

**Check the transcript:**
- VAPI Dashboard ‚Üí Calls ‚Üí Call ID ‚Üí Transcript tab
- Did the AI:
  - Ask for appointment date?
  - Call check_availability?
  - Present time slots?
  - Ask for customer details?
  - Try to book appointment?

---

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ FIXED: Database Schema
```sql
-- Applied just now:
ALTER TABLE public.call_logs
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS raw_vapi_data JSONB;
```

The `raw_vapi_data` column is now added. Future calls will not encounter this database error.

### ‚è≥ PENDING: Root Cause of Booking Failure

We still don't know WHY the booking wasn't completed. Possible reasons:

**Scenario A: AI Never Tried to Book**
- Customer didn't explicitly request booking
- Conversation ended before booking flow started
- AI misunderstood customer intent

**Scenario B: AI Tried But Check Availability Failed**
- Date validation rejected past date (2023 vs 2025)
- Database error during availability check
- No available slots found

**Scenario C: AI Tried But Booking Failed**
- Missing required customer information
- Database error during appointment creation
- SMS confirmation failed (non-blocking error)

**Scenario D: Booking Succeeded But Not Visible**
- Appointment WAS created
- End-of-call-report failed (database error we just fixed)
- User doesn't see it because they're looking at wrong date/org

---

## Next Steps to Diagnose

### Step 1: Check VAPI Dashboard
```
1. Go to https://dashboard.vapi.ai/calls
2. Find call ID: 0199dd52-5bbd-7eeb-a0bb-79fb78f4c65a
3. Check:
   - Full transcript
   - Tool calls section (were any tools called?)
   - Call duration
   - End reason
```

### Step 2: Check Database for Appointment
```sql
-- Check if appointment was actually created
SELECT * FROM appointments
WHERE vapi_call_id = '0199dd52-5bbd-7eeb-a0bb-79fb78f4c65a'
OR created_at > '2025-10-13 11:20:00'::timestamptz
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Step 3: Check Dev Server Logs (NOT errors.md)
```bash
# Check the actual terminal where `npm run dev` is running
# Look for tool call processing logs
# errors.md only captures ERROR logs, not SUCCESS logs
```

### Step 4: Make a New Test Call
Now that the database error is fixed, make a new test call and:
1. Explicitly request: "I want to book an appointment for tomorrow"
2. Follow through the entire booking process
3. Check if appointment appears in database
4. Verify no 500 errors occur

## Why errors.md Doesn't Show Tool Calls

**Important:** The `errors.md` file you're viewing only captures:
- Error logs (console.error)
- Warning logs (console.warn)
- The final end-of-call-report (which failed)

**It does NOT capture:**
- Successful tool call processing (console.log)
- Tool call responses sent to VAPI
- Intermediate webhook events (tool-calls, speech-update, etc.)

**To see successful tool calls, you need to check:**
1. The dev server terminal (where `npm run dev` is running)
2. VAPI Dashboard ‚Üí Call details
3. Database tables (appointments, call_logs, webhook_events)

---

## Summary of Findings

### What We Know:
1. ‚úÖ The database column was missing (`raw_vapi_data`)
2. ‚úÖ This caused end-of-call-report to fail with 500 error
3. ‚úÖ The system prompt includes correct booking instructions
4. ‚úÖ The date validation fixes are in place
5. ‚úÖ Database schema is now fixed

### What We DON'T Know:
1. ‚ùì Did the AI actually call `check_availability` during this call?
2. ‚ùì Did the AI actually call `book_appointment_with_sms` during this call?
3. ‚ùì What did the customer say during the call?
4. ‚ùì Was an appointment actually created (despite the end-of-call-report error)?
5. ‚ùì Did the tool calls succeed or fail?

### To Find Out:
**Check VAPI Dashboard for this call's transcript and tool call logs**

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate:
1. ‚úÖ Database schema fixed (done)
2. ‚è≥ Check VAPI Dashboard for call 0199dd52-5bbd-7eeb-a0bb-79fb78f4c65a
3. ‚è≥ Check database for any appointments created around 11:27 AM
4. ‚è≥ Make a NEW test call to verify everything works now

### Future Prevention:
1. Add better logging for successful tool calls (not just errors)
2. Set up VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET for signature verification
3. Add monitoring for missing database columns
4. Create automated tests for booking flow
